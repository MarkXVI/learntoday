              text="World War II or the Second World War, often abbreviated as WWII or WW2, &#10;was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945. &#10;It involved the vast majority of the world's countries&#10;—including all the great powers—forming two opposing military alliances: &#10;the Allies and the Axis powers. In a state of total war,&#10;directly involving more than 100 million personnel from more than 30 countries, &#10;the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and&#10;scientific capabilities behind the war effort, &#10;blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources.&#10; Aircraft played a major role in the conflict, &#10;including the strategic bombing of population centres, and, &#10;with the development of nuclear weapons, the only two uses of such in war. &#10;World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history, &#10;resulting in 70 to 85 million fatalities, with more civilians than military personnel killed. &#10;Tens of millions of people died due to genocides (including the Holocaust), &#10;starvation, massacres, and disease. In the wake of the war,&#10;Germany and Japan were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted &#10;against German and Japanese leaders.&#10;&#10;World War II is generally considered to have begun on 1 September 1939, &#10;when Nazi Germany, under Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland. &#10;The United Kingdom and France subsequently declared war on the 3rd.&#10; Under the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939, Germany &#10;and the Soviet Union had partitioned Poland&#10;and marked out their &quot;spheres of influence&quot; across Finland, &#10;Romania and the Baltic states. From late 1939 to early 1941, &#10;in a series of campaigns and treaties, &#10;Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe,&#10;and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan (along with&#10;other countries later on). Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and &#10;East Africa, and the fall of France in mid-1940, &#10;the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and&#10;the British Empire, with war in the Balkans, the aerial Battle of Britain, &#10;the Blitz of the UK, and the Battle of the Atlantic. On 22 June 1941, &#10;Germany led the European Axis powers in an invasion of the Soviet Union,&#10; opening the Eastern Front, the largest land theatre of war in history and&#10; trapping the Axis powers, crucially the German Wehrmacht, in a war of attrition.&#10;&#10;Japan, which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific, was at war with the &#10;Republic of China by 1937. In December 1941, &#10;Japan attacked American and British territories&#10; with near-simultaneous offensives against Southeast Asia and&#10; the Central Pacific, including an attack on the US fleet at Pearl Harbor&#10; which forced the US to declare war against Japan; the European Axis &#10;powers declared war on the US in solidarity. Japan soon captured much &#10;of the western Pacific, but its advances were halted in 1942 after losing &#10;the critical Battle of Midway; later, Germany and Italy were defeated in &#10;North Africa and at Stalingrad in the Soviet Union. &#10;Key setbacks in 1943—including a series of German defeats on the Eastern Front, &#10;the Allied invasions of Sicily and the Italian mainland,&#10;and Allied offensives in the Pacific—cost the Axis powers their initiative and&#10;forced it into strategic retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies invaded &#10;German-occupied France, while the Soviet Union regained its territorial losses and &#10;turned towards Germany and its allies. During 1944 and 1945, Japan suffered &#10;reversals in mainland Asia, while the Allies crippled the Japanese Navy and &#10;captured key western Pacific islands.">
