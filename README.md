## Required Libraries
  - FreeTTS (Which can be downloaded here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetts/)
  - JavaFX SDK (Can be downloaded here: https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/)
  - MySQL Connector J (Can be downloaded here: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/)
  - JUnit4 (Which should be possible to import directly from the IDE)

Make sure these libraries are imported into your project.
 
 ## Configure VM-options
   Before you can run the application you must also configure the VM-options in Run/Debug configurations,
   The VM options should include: --module-path "PATH\TO\JAVAFX\LIB\javafx-sdk-11.0.2\lib" --add-modules=javafx.controls,javafx.fxml.
 
 Now if everything is imported correctly and VM-options are configured you should be able to run the program.
